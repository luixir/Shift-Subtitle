1
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,500
Gerald Tate's here.

2
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,900
He wants to know
what's happening to his deal.

3
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,430
Go get Harvey.

4
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,410
I check.

5
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,650
Raise.

6
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,850
5,000.

7
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,920
I'm all-in.

8
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,460
You can pay me later.
I got to go.

9
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,130
Gentlemen.

10
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,800
I'm paying you millions,

11
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,470
and you're telling me
I'm gonna get screwed?

12
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,200
Jessica, have I come
at a bad time?

13
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,470
Gerald, this is Harvey Specter.

14
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,680
He's our best closer.

15
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,180
Well, if you're
the best closer,

16
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,850
where the hell you been
for the last three hours?

17
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,050
Well, Gerald, I specialize
in troubled situations,

18
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,250
and when I left here
at 7:00 P.M.,

19
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,150
this deal wasn't in jeopardy,

20
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,720
so I'm just trying to figure out
what happened in the interim.

21
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,090
We keep offering more money.

22
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,590
They keep rejecting it.

23
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,330
It's last-minute
bad faith bullsh...

24
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,360
Says here that Cooper
won't be staying on

25
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,530
as honorary vice president.

26
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,430
That's right.
I don't want him around.

27
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,500
He wouldn't be around.

28
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,800
It's an honorary position.

29
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,000
I don't give a sh...

30
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,870
Well, I think you do,

31
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,710
because that's what's changed
since I left,

32
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,140
which means it's you
who's been dealing in bad faith.

33
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,340
Well, now that you've got
a grasp on what's happened

34
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,910
in the goddamn interim,

35
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,650
what are you gonna do about it?

36
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,310
Because he's not getting
that title.

37
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,690
Well, let me make sure
I understand this, okay?

38
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,290
We negotiated a deal that
gave you everything you wanted,

39
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,090
Mr. Cooper signed it,
and now you won't close

40
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,960
until we take away
the last shred of his dignity?

41
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,130
- Bingo.
- Well, that's not gonna happen.

42
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,430
- And why the hell not?
- Because I like Mr. Cooper,

43
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,770
and my firm doesn't operate
in bad faith.

44
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,670
Oh. I see how it is.

45
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,910
Instead of working Cooper,

46
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,170
you're working me.

47
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,580
Well, why don't you take
your pansy attitude

48
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,180
back in there
and make him sign my deal?

49
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,910
Or I'll pay someone else
your money

50
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,450
to do it for me.
First of all, Gerald,

51
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,290
if you think
anyone's gonna touch this deal

52
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,220
after your bad faith,
you're mistaken.

53
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,660
Second, the way
our agreement works is,

54
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,290
the minute Cooper
signed the deal

55
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,860
which gave you everything
you wanted,

56
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,900
our fee was due and payable,
which is why at 7:30

57
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,970
I received confirmation
of a wire transfer

58
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,070
from escrow indicating payment
in full.

59
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,950
So I'd say
the ball's in your court,

60
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,550
but the truth is
your balls are in my fist.

61
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,020
Now I apologize if that image
is too pansy for you,

62
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,450
but I'm comfortable enough
with my manhood

63
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,790
to put it out there.

64
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,420
Now get your ass in there

65
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,530
and close the goddamn deal.

66
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,290
You gonna let him talk to me
like this?

67
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,700
Harvey speaks for the firm.

68
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,310
We got paid
before Gerald signed the deal?

69
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,750
What are you talking about?
This is a memo

70
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,420
about some fire drill
on Tuesday.

71
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,080
- Huh.
- You're the Blue Team Captain.

72
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,990
You get to wear a fire hat.

73
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,070
Time's up.

74
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,500
Pencils down.

75
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,340
Excuse me.
Do I know you from somewhere?

76
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,270
I don't think so.

77
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,250
I have a pretty good memory
for faces.

78
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,410
So do I.

79
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,980
- Sorry.
- I got it.

80
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,160
Hey. Hey!

81
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,670
Stop! You in the cap!

82
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,670
What did you get me?

83
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,270
What I said
I was gonna get you.

84
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,340
A 158.
I told you I wanted a 175.

85
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,640
And I told you
only 1 out of 100 people

86
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,580
can score that.

87
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,580
You're a B-minus student.
You got 1,000 on your sats.

88
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,210
If I get you a 175,
they'll know you cheated.

89
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,120
So only a genius loser
can get a 175?

90
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,650
Actually, no.
I would get a 180.

91
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,090
Now can I have my money,
please?

92
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,500
Whoa. This is only half.

93
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,000
Then why don't you
go call the police?

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,510
I got to get my sh... together.

95
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,510
That's the best cheeseburger
I've had in my life.

96
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,050
It's from Monday, Trevor.

97
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,350
Look, man, I'm serious.

98
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,950
I almost got caught today.

99
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,420
I've got
to stop getting stoned.

100
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,720
I've got to get
my act together.

101
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,250
Dude, look at me.

102
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,760
You can burn bud
and still be a success.

103
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,430
You sell pot for a living.

104
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,390
Still saps the motivation.

105
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,100
All I'm saying is, you want in,

106
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,560
you are in.

107
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,570
You know, that is word for word

108
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,470
your offer before I got caught

109
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,600
cheating on your math test
in the third grade.

110
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,670
Goddamn memory.

111
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,440
Stop.

112
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,640
Look, no one's gonna suspect
you're a dealer.

113
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,640
I mean, look at me.

114
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,510
This is a $2,000 suit, Mike.

115
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,980
I got, like, 12 of 'em.

116
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,750
I take on
real software projects.

117
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:56,450
I have clients who bring me
briefcases filled with cash,

118
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,020
and I hand them
identical briefcases

119
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,490
with vacuum-sealed bud.

120
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,290
So what do you need me for?

121
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,560
Well, I have a client
coming in from out of town,

122
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,200
and I can't meet him,

123
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,170
and I need someone I can trust
to make the drop.

124
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,770
It's totally safe.

125
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,500
Trevor, a person
is more likely to die

126
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,940
while dealing drugs
than they would be

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,200
on death row in Texas.

128
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,670
Wait.
What are you talking about?

129
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,010
It's from <i>Freakonomics.</i>

130
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,170
Do you read anything
that I give you?

131
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,040
It doesn't matter,

132
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,680
because you have to find
somebody else.

133
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,910
I'm not interested.

134
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,080
Not interested in what?

135
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,320
What are you doing here?
You said you were gonna stay

136
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,320
at your place tonight.

137
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,080
Hi, sweetie.

138
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,550
What a pleasant surprise.

139
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,460
I'm so glad you stopped by.
Yeah.

140
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,690
We're in the middle
of something.

141
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,730
What are you in the middle of?

142
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,590
Trevor's trying to set me up.

143
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,960
That's terrific.

144
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,800
Who's the lucky girl?

145
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,670
I'm trying to get him
to work for me.

146
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,540
That's a great idea.

147
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,070
It will take some stress
off Trevor,

148
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,140
and you'll pick up writing code

149
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,110
like you do everything else.

150
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,610
All right. I got to go.

151
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,340
I got go get up early
to see my grandmother

152
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,450
and pay them another month.

153
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,010
Oh.

154
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,920
- Good night.
- Bye.

155
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,490
How did you know Gerald
wouldn't look at that memo?

156
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,560
Because a charging bull
always looks at the red cape,

157
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,090
not at the man with the sword.

158
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,230
By the way,
I've set up a meeting

159
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,430
for you and John Dockery
next week.

160
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,930
Dockery?
He's Skadden's biggest client.

161
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Not anymore.

162
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,830
He's looking around.

163
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,170
He plays tennis.
I want you to close him.

164
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,600
Consider it done.

165
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,640
Then you are
officially dismissed

166
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,510
for the evening.

167
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,180
Cheers.

168
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
Well, you two seem
to be celebrating something.

169
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,580
Mm-hmm. We are.

170
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,150
In fact, you are looking

171
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,450
at the best closer
this city has ever seen.

172
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,750
Closer, huh?

173
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,150
Baseball? Attorney.

174
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,650
I close situations.

175
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,560
Hmm.
So you only care about money?

176
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,390
The truth is,
I do it for the children.

177
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,900
I'm Lisa.

178
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,200
Harvey.

179
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,270
Lisa, I don't normally do this,

180
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,940
but since we are celebrating,

181
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,840
what time do you get off
tonight?

182
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,840
I'm glad you asked.

183
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,150
I get off at ten past
"I'm never going out with you."

184
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,820
I guess you're not the best
closer this city's ever seen.

185
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,760
♪ ♪

186
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,270
Good morning.

187
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,900
Lisa, this was lovely,

188
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,670
but I'm afraid you have to go.

189
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,410
- Aw.
- I hate to miss a workout,

190
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,710
and I really need
to be in the office by 7:30.

191
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,980
Can't we have breakfast?

192
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,480
You could eat it
off my stomach.

193
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,750
I guess if I skip the gym,

194
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,720
I can still get in by 9:00.

195
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,200
I hear someone's
not taking their pills.

196
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,870
Because they're trying
to poison me.

197
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,070
Grammy, that's crazy.

198
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,540
Dr. shrager gave me her word

199
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,040
she wouldn't poison you
until January.

200
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,640
If she does it before then,
she can't count it

201
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,840
towards next year's quota.

202
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,010
Oh, what did I teach you?

203
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,720
Michael, I'm not gonna be
around forever.

204
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:19,160
And I want you to stop
with that stuff.

205
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,460
What stuff?

206
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,030
I may be old,

207
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,960
but I'm not an idiot.

208
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,170
I know life has been hard
for you,

209
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,670
but you're not a kid anymore,

210
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,440
and I want you to promise

211
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,840
you're gonna start living up
to your potential.

212
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,110
I promise.

213
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,390
I'm not saying that I haven't
been charmed by Harvey,

214
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,220
but it's just so patronizing

215
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,960
when you say
that he can handle those things

216
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,490
and, "Louis,
you can only handle this."

217
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,390
Jessica, I could have handled
Gerald Tate.

218
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,730
And I told you I disagree.

219
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,630
- Why?
- Because when you put

220
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,960
two bullies
in the same room together,

221
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,960
things generally
don't go so well.

222
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,430
It's 9:30.
Nice of you to show up

223
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,300
two hours after we open
for business.

224
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,340
And I see that you're also
trying to look like a pimp.

225
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,200
My bad, Louis.
I was out late last night.

226
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,140
And when I woke up,
this is the suit

227
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,470
your wife picked out for me.

228
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,110
And that would be funny

229
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,910
if I'd actually been married.
Moving along.

230
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,080
- You're not married?
- Recruiting. Harvey.

231
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,780
Your interviews are set up
for tomorrow.

232
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,280
What? Why don't we just hire

233
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,150
the Harvard summer associate
douche?

234
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,320
I think if you listen
to the phrasing

235
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,320
of that question,
you'll come up with an answer.

236
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,130
We need people who think
on their feet,

237
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,690
not another clone
with a rod up his ass.

238
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,660
Harvey, the fact
that we only hire from Harvard

239
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,600
gives us a cache
that's a little more valuable

240
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,200
than hiring a kid from Rutgers.

241
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,970
You went to Harvard law.

242
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,870
I'm an exception.

243
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,470
Find me another one.

244
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,310
Can we please skip
the recruiting?

245
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,010
I work better alone anyway.

246
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,610
Well, I would, Harvey,

247
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,650
except all senior partners
get an associate.

248
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,520
It's just a rule.

249
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,180
I'm sorry. What?

250
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,450
Jessica, I deserve
that promotion.

251
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,220
My billables destroy his.

252
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,690
And I'm here night and day
doing whatever's needed

253
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,290
instead of swanning
in and out of here

254
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,030
whenever I please.

255
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,500
I must admit, he does make me
sound very swan-like.

256
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,600
Harvey,

257
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,470
shut up.

258
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,400
Louis, this is how it is.

259
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,740
All right,
now you two make nice.

260
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,240
Louis, I apologize.
I was out of line.

261
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,010
Now if you'll just let me text
your pretend wife

262
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,280
that I just made senior partner,
I... what?

263
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,280
Your grandmother's
getting worse.

264
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,220
I need to move her to full care

265
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,250
or I'll have to transfer her
to the state facility.

266
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,220
I won't put her
in a state facility.

267
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,720
Then I'm afraid you'll have
to come up with $25,000.

268
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,130
Trevor, I'm in.

269
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,530
One-time deal. I want 25.

270
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,600
Take it or leave it.

271
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,830
I'll take it.

272
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,970
There's a briefcase in my room.

273
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,140
Pick it up tomorrow,

274
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,840
take it to room 2412

275
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,300
at the Chilton Hotel.

276
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,940
Now you can't go
to a luxury hotel

277
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,810
looking like a delivery guy,
so shave,

278
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,710
comb your hair, buy a suit.

279
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,440
That's a hell
of a lot to ask, man.

280
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,880
Well, I'm not asking you.
I'm paying you $25,000.

281
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:57,910
Okay?

282
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,780
Yeah, he's in.

283
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,150
Good.

284
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,320
I'm gonna go take a piss.

285
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,460
Key.

286
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,660
24 hours, we'll know

287
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,760
if this new buyer's a cop.

288
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,070
Why didn't you tell Trevor
he might be sending

289
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,630
his guy into a setup?

290
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,630
Same reason
why I don't tell Gina

291
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,870
I'm banging her sister.

292
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,540
It'll only cause trouble.

293
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,910
What's up?

294
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,580
I'm just gonna take off.

295
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,580
I don't think you should.

296
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,620
Why don't you stay with us
till tomorrow?

297
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,550
Now give me your cell phone.

298
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,020
Give me your phone.

299
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:38,350
Don't even think
about warning your boy.

300
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,890
'Cause if these guys are cops,
whoever's holding that weed

301
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,760
is going to jail
for a long time.

302
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,930
Hey.

303
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,900
Hey. God, you scared the hell
out of me.

304
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:52,940
Sorry.

305
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,110
Look at you.

306
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,710
You look great. Thanks.

307
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,280
Tell me you decided
to work with Trevor.

308
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,110
Yeah. Trial basis. Yeah.

309
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,990
What are you doing here?

310
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,690
My mom is coming
by my place later.

311
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,820
And I don't want to mess it up,

312
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:12,760
so I'm hanging here.

313
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,790
Got to go.

314
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,500
Hey. Come here.

315
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,870
Mm.

316
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,870
You want to look perfect
on your first day.

317
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,740
Yeah.

318
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,380
I've got to go.

319
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,250
Mm-hmm.

320
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,830
Great. Thanks.

321
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,870
Donna, we're gonna need
to streamline this.

322
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,700
Give each guy a hard time.

323
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,270
Before you send them back,

324
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,870
give me a wink
if they say something clever.

325
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,610
Cool? Okay.

326
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,680
What are you looking for?

327
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,950
Another me.

328
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,910
So, chip,

329
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,810
what makes you think

330
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,410
that I'm gonna let
the whitest man

331
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,610
that I have ever seen
interview for our firm?

332
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,510
Because I have an appointment.

333
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,150
Hmm.

334
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,310
You can do this.

335
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,190
Kid, what is wrong with you?

336
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,530
You look
like you're 11 years old.

337
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
I was late to puberty.

338
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,500
Harvey Specter.

339
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,470
Uh, excuse me.

340
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,600
I was thinking
about going for a swim.

341
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,900
Are the pool facilities here
nice?

342
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,140
Of course, sir.

343
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,240
This is the Chilton Hotel.

344
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,340
And do you have the time?

345
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:16,410
Yes, uh...

346
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,580
10:00. Thanks.

347
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,090
- He saw your gun.
- You think that's him?

348
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,800
Matches the description.

349
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,530
But he didn't go in the room.

350
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,600
It's 10:00 exactly.
He's just walking by?

351
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,610
Go after him.
Stay on the radio.

352
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,900
Rick Sorkin.

353
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,300
Rick Sorkin.

354
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,440
Rick Sorkin?

355
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,710
Excuse me, Mr. Sorkin,

356
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,240
you are five minutes late.

357
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,980
Is there a reason
why I should let you in?

358
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,580
Look, I'm just trying
to ditch the cops, okay?

359
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,320
I don't really care
if you let me in or not.

360
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,860
Mr. Specter will be
right with you.

361
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,330
What?

362
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,230
Can I get you anything?
A coffee or a bottle of water?

363
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,300
Hi, Rick Sorkin.

364
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,270
Harvey Specter.
Nice to meet you.

365
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,770
Why don't you have a seat here?

366
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,940
Whoa. What's this?

367
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,120
Can I help you?

368
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,590
No.

369
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,690
How the hell did you know
they were the police?

370
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,130
I read this novel
in elementary school,

371
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,530
and it was
the exact same thing.

372
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,230
You read a novel
in elementary school.

373
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,500
What? I like to read.

374
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,940
And why'd you ask them
what time it was?

375
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,300
Throw 'em off.

376
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,670
What kind of drug dealer

377
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,340
asks a cop what time it is

378
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,140
when he's got a briefcase
full of pot, right?

379
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,480
We should hire you.

380
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,280
Jesus, I'd give you
the 25 grand

381
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,550
as a signing bonus.

382
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:31,980
I'll take it.

383
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,750
Unfortunately,

384
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,390
we only hire from Harvard.

385
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,720
And you not only did not go
to Harvard law school,

386
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,930
you haven't even gone
to any law school.

387
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,400
What if I told you
that I consume knowledge

388
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,660
like no one you've ever met,

389
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,600
and I've actually passed
the bar?

390
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:50,000
I'd say you're full of crap.

391
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,710
That's a barbri legal handbook
right there, right?

392
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,340
Open it up. Read me something.

393
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:57,410
Anything.

394
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,750
"Civil liability associated
with agency is based

395
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,180
on several factors..."
"Including the deviation

396
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,750
"of the agent from his path,

397
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,720
"the reasonable inference
of agency on behalf

398
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,850
"of the plaintiff,
and the nature

399
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,660
of the damages themselves."

400
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,730
How did you know that?

401
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:19,600
I learned it when I studied
for the bar.

402
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,500
Okay, hotshot,

403
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,440
fire up this laptop.

404
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,170
I'm gonna show you

405
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,680
what a Harvard attorney can do.

406
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,880
Pick a topic.

407
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,550
Stock option backdating.

408
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,520
Although backdating options
is legal,

409
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,250
violations arise
related to disclosures

410
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,390
under IRC section 409A.

411
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,560
You forgot
about sarbanes-oxley.

412
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,090
The statute of limitations

413
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,700
renders sarbanes-oxley moot
post 2007.

414
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,560
Not if you can find actions

415
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,330
to cover up the violation

416
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,000
as established in
the sixth circuit, may 2008.

417
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,070
That's impressive, but you're
sitting at a computer.

418
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,180
Playing hearts.

419
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,950
Sorry. If you want to beat me,

420
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,680
you're gonna have to do it
at something else.

421
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,550
How can you know all that?

422
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,080
I told you. I like to read.

423
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,950
And once I read something,
I understand it.

424
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,160
And once I understand it,
I never forget it.

425
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,790
Why take the bar?

426
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,600
This dickhead bet me
I couldn't pass it

427
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,800
without going to law school.

428
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,470
Okay, look,

429
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,670
this is
all pretty fascinating stuff,

430
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,840
but I'm afraid
I got to get back to work.

431
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,440
I'll make sure
that serpico isn't around

432
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,440
waiting for you.

433
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,830
You want this job so much,

434
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,730
why didn't you just go
to law school?

435
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,130
When I was in college,

436
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,700
it was my dream to be a lawyer.

437
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,170
I needed some money,

438
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,370
and Trevor convinced me

439
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,440
to memorize this math test

440
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,500
and to sell it.

441
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,670
Turns out we sold it
to the Dean's daughter.

442
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,180
I lost my scholarship,
I got kicked out of school,

443
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,910
I...

444
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,390
I got knocked
into a different life.

445
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,750
And I have been wishing
for a way back ever since.

446
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,330
Let me tell you something.

447
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,030
This isn't elementary school.
This is hard work.

448
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,030
Long hours. High pressure.

449
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,200
I need a grown goddamn man.

450
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,270
You give me this,

451
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,270
and I will work
as hard as it takes

452
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,980
to school those Harvard douches

453
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,810
and become the best lawyer
you have ever seen.

454
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,250
I'm inclined
to give you a shot,

455
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,780
but what if I decide
to go another way?

456
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,120
I'd say that's fair.

457
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,550
Sometimes I like to hang out
with people

458
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,320
who aren't that bright,
you know,

459
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,490
just to see
how the other half lives.

460
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,790
Move over.

461
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,660
I'm emailing the firm
I just found our next associate.

462
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,900
All right.
You're gonna start a week

463
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,100
from Monday.

464
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,500
Here's what you're gonna do.

465
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,400
First, no more pot.
We drug test.

466
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,940
Stop smoking now,
you'll be fine,

467
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,470
I assume that's all the drugs
you do.

468
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,240
- How do you know that?
- You read books, I read people.

469
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,550
And potheads smoke pot.
That's what they do.

470
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,420
It's not all I do.
I have interests.

471
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,880
You're Albert
friggin' Einstein,

472
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,550
and you couldn't manage
to get into law school?

473
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,890
You think that's not
from smoking weed?

474
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,260
- Trevor got...
- That's another thing.

475
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,160
You're never gonna talk
to Trevor again.

476
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,760
You're gonna ditch
that briefcase,

477
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,590
and you're gonna get on a plane
to Harvard,

478
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,230
and you're gonna learn
everything there is

479
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,330
about going
to law school there.

480
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,360
Did you buy that suit? Yeah.

481
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,130
Let's buy some new ones.

482
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:48,010
Hi.

483
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,580
How do I sign up
for today's law school tour?

484
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,780
You go back in time six weeks

485
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,210
because
that's when it booked up.

486
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,920
Um...

487
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,280
This is Harvard law.

488
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,390
We get over 7,000 applications
a year.

489
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,890
You think you can just walk in
and take a tour?

490
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,230
Thank you.

491
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,200
Eduardo Fernandez,
who, first of all,

492
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,970
looks like he works
at the public pool or something,

493
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,700
and he comes up to me
the other day,

494
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,000
and I completely know
he's a freshman.

495
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,410
And he looks at me and he goes,

496
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,640
"Where's
the public health school?"

497
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,280
Which is right
around the corner,

498
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,580
and you know what I tell him?
Clifford Watkins?

499
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,250
Excuse me.

500
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,310
Can I help you?

501
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,050
Jonathan atwater.

502
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,680
I work for Dean wormer
in the admissions office.

503
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,950
Yes, of course.
What can I do for you?

504
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,720
Well, the Dean
personally sent me down here

505
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:33,020
to invite you
to a small cocktail hour

506
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:37,060
for some of
our more realistic candidates.

507
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,360
And we'd like to keep
this sort of thing discreet,

508
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,630
so if you'd subtly hand me
your name tag,

509
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,930
you can proceed
directly to the Dean's office.

510
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,900
Congratulations.

511
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,040
Harvard law
is the oldest law school

512
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,710
in the country and boasts

513
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,250
the most successful graduates
in the world.

514
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:00,480
Currently, we are six
of nine supreme court justices

515
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:03,090
and, of course, the president
of the United States.

516
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,900
Uh, hi, good morning.

517
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:55,930
I'm here to see... Have a seat.

518
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,940
Thank you.

519
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,690
Mike Ross?

520
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,890
Hi, I'm Rachel Zane.

521
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,960
I'll be giving you
your orientation.

522
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:31,100
- Wow. You're pretty.
- Good. You've hit on me.

523
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,500
We can get it out of the way
that I am not interested.

524
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:34,640
No, I'm sorry.
I wasn't hitting on you.

525
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,700
Trust me.

526
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,310
I've given dozens of these,

527
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,240
and without fail,
whatever new hotshot it is

528
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,610
thinks that,
because I'm just a paralegal,

529
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,380
that I will
somehow be blown away

530
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,810
by his dazzling degree.

531
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,110
Let me assure you, I won't.

532
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:49,650
I was. I was hitting on you.

533
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,490
You were. Take notes.

534
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,760
I'm not gonna repeat myself.

535
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:56,130
I love you.

536
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:59,160
The firm operates
on a chain of command model.

537
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,770
Harvey's
your commanding officer.

538
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,630
However, Louis Litt,
he oversees all associates,

539
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,270
so you'll also answer to him.

540
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,070
What do you think about Harvey?

541
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,840
People are in awe of him.

542
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,570
They say he's the best closer
there is,

543
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,910
but I have very little contact
with him,

544
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,110
so I don't know.

545
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,480
And what about Louis Litt?

546
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:19,620
Let's continue with your tour.

547
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,850
Hey, Becky. You are glowing.

548
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,450
I wonder why that is. Oh, yeah.

549
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,790
It's the day
they announce my promotion.

550
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,360
Jimmy, have you lost weight?

551
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,490
Steve-O.

552
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,230
Looking like a guy
who came to work.

553
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,530
Excuse me,
why are you scratching off

554
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,870
the senior off my door?

555
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,870
I got a work order
to take it off.

556
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,870
- Who issued the work order?
- My supervisor.

557
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,870
Why did he issue
the work order?

558
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,880
If I knew that,
I'd be his supervisor.

559
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,740
You seem
to be enjoying yourself.

560
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,150
I haven't enjoyed myself
since 2004.

561
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,980
Donna!

562
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,550
Someone's trying to have
a little fun with me here.

563
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,250
Jessica wants to see you
in her office.

564
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,020
Now.

565
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:02,890
And finally,
this is where you'll live.

566
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,730
Wow.

567
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,900
I gave you that for a reason.
You haven't taken one note.

568
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,130
- That's because...
- Because you were

569
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,770
too busy ogling me to listen

570
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,070
to a word I've said?

571
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,570
Partners' offices
anchor the wings.

572
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,210
Fifth floor's research,
sixth is security.

573
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,910
All work gets billed,
even if it's finding an address.

574
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,280
I answer to Harvey

575
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,950
and Louis Litt,
and, judging by the way

576
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,720
you responded to my questions,

577
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:28,390
I should admire Harvey
and I should fear Louis.

578
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,090
You have been here
for five years,

579
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,520
and just because I outrank you

580
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,690
does not mean
I have the authority

581
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,930
to command your services.

582
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,360
Oh, it's also pretty clear

583
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,800
that you think you're too smart

584
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,930
to be a paralegal.

585
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,300
You know what nobody likes?

586
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,040
Nobody likes a showoff.

587
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,410
You used the word "ogling."

588
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,580
When do I get to see Harvey?

589
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,880
Gerald Tate fired the firm.

590
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,080
So you're taking
my promotion away.

591
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,950
You know, most firms would put
you in front of the bar

592
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,580
and have your license stripped.

593
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,390
You lied to a client,
and he figured it out.

594
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,790
I lied to him to get him
to do the right thing

595
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,360
and honor his goddamn contract.

596
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,630
And you didn't seem
to mind so much

597
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,930
when you thought
I got away with it.

598
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,130
But you didn't get away
with it.

599
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,570
And I can't justify handing you
a promotion

600
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:10,930
on the same day that you lose
a huge client.

601
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,570
One client doesn't make a firm.

602
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,070
I don't know if you've noticed,

603
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,440
but we're in the middle
of an economic meltdown.

604
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,880
Companies
aren't exactly lining up

605
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,740
to spend money
on attorneys right now.

606
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:23,850
And, you know, Gerald might
have forgiven the lying

607
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,180
had you not humiliated him.

608
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,650
But you did,
and you need to accept that.

609
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,720
Jessica, if you hadn't done
as much for me as you have,

610
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,760
I'd be heading for the door.

611
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,490
If I hadn't done as much
for you as I have,

612
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,360
I'd be throwing you
out the window.

613
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:45,470
But, Harvey,
no more shenanigans.

614
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:48,370
You do one more thing
that isn't straight as an arrow,

615
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,440
and instead
of covering your ass,

616
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,970
I will put you
in front of the bar myself.

617
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,680
- Mike.
- Hey.

618
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,250
Who's ready
for a great first day?

619
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,150
I'm gonna have to let you go.

620
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,190
- What?
- I just got reamed

621
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,790
for lying to a client,

622
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,460
and if they find out
that I lied about you

623
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,790
going to Harvard,
they'll take away my license.

624
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,060
You what?

625
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,630
Not now, Donna.

626
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,200
Look, I have to put
my own interests

627
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,700
above yours.
It's nothing personal.

628
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,300
You're fired.

629
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:20,770
Wait, so you're worried
that if I stay,

630
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,110
then they might find out
that you lied about me

631
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,510
and you'll lose your license.

632
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,780
But if you fire me,
then I could tell them

633
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,410
that you lied about me,

634
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,980
and you'd definitely lose
your license.

635
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:34,620
Are you telling me that

636
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,150
if I throw you under the bus,

637
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,590
you're gonna drag me with you?

638
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,620
You put your interests
above mine,

639
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:43,190
and I'm just putting mine
back up next to yours.

640
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,400
You're rehired.

641
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,200
So should I... all right.

642
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:53,740
Here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna give me back

643
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,100
my promotion,
and that's the last

644
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,270
we're gonna talk about this.

645
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,970
And why is that?

646
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,810
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna go across town

647
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,640
and join Rick Peterson.

648
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,610
I'm gonna approach every client
I've ever closed,

649
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,480
and I'm gonna
take them with me.

650
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,280
You do that,
and you'll force me

651
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,850
to put you in front
of the ethics board.

652
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,590
- I don't think you will.
- And why not?

653
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,220
Because you were obligated
to notify them

654
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,360
the second I lied to Gerald,
but you didn't.

655
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,130
You put me in front
of the board right now,

656
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,460
I'll put you right up there
with me.

657
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:20,030
Hmm.

658
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,440
I'll... I'll give you
your promotion.

659
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,210
But you have to do something
for me.

660
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,440
Anything.

661
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,780
Ah. Pro Bono.

662
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,880
Anything but that.

663
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,450
Harvey, Pro Bono cases

664
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,290
are how we, as a firm,
show that we care

665
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,820
about more than just ourselves.

666
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:42,090
I'm not saying
we shouldn't do them.

667
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,590
I'm saying I shouldn't do them.

668
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,160
And it's how you can show me

669
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,660
that you care about more
than just yourself.

670
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,960
You'll handle this yourself.

671
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,330
You will not pass it off.

672
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,930
Absolutely.

673
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,340
Your first case.

674
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,370
Awesome. What is it?

675
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,380
Pro Bono.

676
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,980
Sexual harassment.

677
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,080
Don't tell anyone
I laid it off on you,

678
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,910
and don't screw it up. Got it.

679
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,950
You can't handle it.
I'll knock it out of the park.

680
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,050
Easy, Clarence Thomas.
Just go meet the client.

681
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,160
Hey. Didn't I tell you
to get some better suits?

682
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,260
I spent $500.

683
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,200
For how many suits?

684
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,500
Five.

685
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,900
What?

686
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,500
Nancy?

687
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,170
- Mike?
- Yeah, hi.

688
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,470
You're a kid.

689
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,540
No, I'm a... I'm a grown man.

690
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:34,340
You're so skinny. Have a grape.

691
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,050
Thank you.

692
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,080
Why don't you tell me
your story?

693
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,780
It started two years ago.

694
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,250
I was a stay-at-home mom

695
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,220
to my son, Freddie.

696
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,120
And one day
we were at little league,

697
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,760
Freddie was five.

698
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,190
He really hated
that he couldn't play

699
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,590
with the older kids.

700
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,160
It was the third inning,
and I got a phone call.

701
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,500
My husband had been
in a car accident,

702
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,560
and he was gone,
just like that.

703
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,930
I'm so sorry.

704
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,040
I did the best I could.

705
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,910
I got myself a job
as a secretary

706
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:06,270
at Devlin McGreggor.

707
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,540
And I even got promoted

708
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,810
to secretary of the president,

709
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,910
Charles Hunt.

710
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,050
And that's when it all changed.

711
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,450
It's okay.
Tell me what happened.

712
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,690
He started asking me
to stay late,

713
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,860
order in dinners together,
stuff like that.

714
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,230
One night, he says
that if I sleep with him,

715
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,660
he's gonna take care of me
in the firm,

716
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:28,260
and, if I don't,
he's gonna fire me.

717
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,500
So what did you do?

718
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,830
I went to human resources.

719
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,800
They said they investigated,

720
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,270
couldn't find anything
to support my claim.

721
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,810
Two months later, I was fired

722
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,580
for poor job performance.

723
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,250
They wouldn't let me
say good-bye to anybody.

724
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,610
They wouldn't write me
a letter of recommendation.

725
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,280
I wasn't looking for a payoff.

726
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,750
All I wanted
was for it to stop.

727
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,690
Can you help me?

728
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,690
Uh, yes.

729
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,090
Yes, I can.

730
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,630
What do you need my help for?

731
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,730
- Wait, can I just...
- No, give me the update.

732
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,030
You know, she's a nice woman.

733
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,470
She... On the case.

734
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:02,930
I don't get
emotionally attached

735
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,330
to the client.

736
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,140
This woman had
her life ripped apart.

737
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,740
You don't even care?

738
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:09,440
I'm not about caring.
I'm about winning.

739
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,310
Why can't you be about both?

740
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,880
I'd explain it to you,

741
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:16,180
but then I'd have
to care about you.

742
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,820
What are you doing?

743
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,050
Don't touch that.

744
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,820
I'm just checking my lock.

745
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:23,990
You ride your bike to...

746
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,020
It's locked, okay?

747
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,630
Come on.

748
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,600
Defense sent over
the investigation files

749
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,200
as a courtesy. No, they didn't.

750
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,670
Nobody does anything
as a courtesy.

751
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,300
They sent those files

752
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,510
because that's
where they want you to look.

753
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,810
Listen, being a lawyer's

754
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,780
like being a doctor.

755
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,180
You mean how you don't get
emotional about the client?

756
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,380
No, I mean you keep pressing
until it hurts.

757
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:47,880
Then you know where to look.

758
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,620
Forget about impeaching
the investigation.

759
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,420
It won't lead anywhere.
No employee's gonna testify

760
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:52,920
against their own CEO. Okay.

761
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,790
So what do you suggest I do?

762
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,860
Think.
This guy's done this once...

763
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,660
He's done it before.

764
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,090
And if the people
who work for him now

765
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,590
won't testify against him...

766
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,200
Someone who used
to work for him might.

767
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,700
You know what,

768
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,400
I'd subpoena
the personnel records

769
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,930
of every woman
who's left the firm

770
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,500
during this guy's tenure.
That's funny.

771
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:12,100
That's exactly what I thought.

772
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,640
Then what do you need
my help for?

773
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:16,110
I don't know
how to fill out a subpoena.

774
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:20,980
Figure it out yourself.

775
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,180
Donna, can you show me
how to fill out a subpoena?

776
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,750
Absolutely. And after that,

777
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,290
you want me to show you
how to wipe your ass?

778
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,350
It's funny,
because you should already know

779
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,720
how to do both those things.

780
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,620
Ha, yeah, that's hilarious.

781
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,730
What's that?
That's my suit guy.

782
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,930
Go in, tell him I sent you,
and spend some money.

783
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:37,360
What does it matter
how much money I spend on suits?

784
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,970
People respond
to how we're dressed,

785
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,530
so like it or not,
this is what you have to do.

786
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,540
That's weird,
you giving me advice.

787
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,970
It sounds like you actually care
about me.

788
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,840
I don't.
You're a reflection of me,

789
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,640
and I absolutely care about me.

790
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,980
So get your skinny tie
out of my face and get to work.

791
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,280
That was a little harsh.

792
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,850
Really?

793
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,620
Yeah.

794
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,790
Mike.

795
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,860
Where are you going?

796
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,560
It's 6:30. I'm going home.

797
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,400
Okay. What's so funny?

798
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,030
You're a rookie associate.

799
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,570
If you go home before 9:00
on your first week,

800
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,710
you're not gonna make it
through your first month.

801
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:23,170
And Louis Litt
wants to see you.

802
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,180
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.

803
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,710
This tie, is it too skinny?

804
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,950
Yeah.

805
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:32,020
Right.

806
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,980
Yeah.

807
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,790
I know you had orientation
from Rachel,

808
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:47,670
but I wanted to give you
a special welcome from me.

809
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:52,000
Amongst other things,
I'm sort of the disciplinarian

810
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,000
of the associates.

811
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,310
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

812
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,780
Gary, please come in.
Mike, this is Gary Lipsky.

813
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,710
Gary's one of our most promising
associates from last year.

814
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,480
Hi.

815
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:07,250
Gary, Ms. Pearson
wanted me to ask,

816
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,790
have you completed
the petramco filing?

817
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,490
Well, my brother was in
over the weekend,

818
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,690
so I didn't really get to it.

819
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,460
Look, I mean, Gary, come on.

820
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,630
This is, like, the third time
I've had to ask.

821
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,090
I'll get right on it.

822
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,860
Don't bother. You're fired.

823
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,800
What? You can't fire me.

824
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,430
Oh, yes, I can. And I just did.

825
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,130
Go pack up your things.

826
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,370
Don't you ever show your face
in this place again.

827
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,610
See, I arranged
for you to see that

828
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,150
because we pay our associates
very well

829
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,990
and we provide the opportunity
for unlimited advancement.

830
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,490
But in return
we expect results.

831
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,200
Have I made myself clear?

832
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,430
Yeah.

833
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,340
Great.

834
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,440
Welcome to Pearson Hardman.

835
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,810
Feel free to go back to work.

836
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,450
Harvey.

837
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,590
Okay, I have two words for you.

838
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,290
Absolutely beautiful.

839
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,790
You think you're the only one
who can charm a client?

840
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,630
Categorically stunning.

841
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,660
How's the new kid working out?

842
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:25,830
Regally hot.

843
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,530
- You're an idiot.
- Jessica Pearson.

844
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,600
Good night, Harvey.

845
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:39,610
What are you doing here?

846
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,120
Watching <i>sportscenter.</i>

847
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,780
Boo-yah.

848
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,190
You won't return
my phone calls.

849
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,350
Ah, yeah,
because you set me up.

850
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,590
Do you remember that?
You think I knew about that?

851
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,360
Here we go.
Round 50 of I get the shaft

852
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,560
because you didn't know
the whole story.

853
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,360
You knew there were risks
when you quoted that crap

854
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,630
from that book.

855
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,270
Okay, you needed money,

856
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,670
and I came through
with an opportunity

857
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,540
like always.

858
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,600
Besides, you weren't
the only one who got screwed.

859
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,010
They pulled a gun on me.

860
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,110
Oh, really?

861
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,480
And why did they do that?

862
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,740
To keep me from warning you.

863
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:11,410
So you did know.

864
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,910
Well, not until
after it was too late.

865
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,510
Well, it's too late now.

866
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,350
Look, let me make it up to you.

867
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,020
Oh, you want
to make it up to me?

868
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,920
Give me my key back.

869
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,500
Michael.

870
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,600
Come on.

871
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,830
You know I don't want
to live in a world

872
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,040
where we're not tight.

873
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,840
Then kill yourself.

874
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,440
Get out.

875
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,080
Get the hell out.

876
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,840
Donna, I need the...

877
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,640
oh, also I didn't have
a chance to...

878
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,270
marry me?
I took care of that too.

879
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,940
We've been married
for the last seven years.

880
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,040
Excellent.

881
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,120
Umm, Devlin McGreggor's
fighting the subpoena.

882
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,940
They filed a motion
to dismiss the case

883
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,270
based on our lack of evidence.

884
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,250
- Good.
- Good.

885
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,820
Wait, what do you mean, "good"?

886
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,250
They don't want
to hand over the files.

887
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,720
You pressed where it hurt.

888
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,260
You're looking
in the right place.

889
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,490
Did you think
they wouldn't fight back?

890
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,220
Well, I...
now that you mention it.

891
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,690
Oh, my bad.

892
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,060
I keep forgetting

893
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,460
you don't
actually know anything.

894
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:41,160
The idea is,

895
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,970
you make a move,
they make a move.

896
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,630
You go back and forth
until one of you wins.

897
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,240
Okay, what if they win
the motion

898
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,100
and the case gets dismissed?

899
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:50,470
You're not as good
as you think you are.

900
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,610
Harvey. What a coincidence.

901
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,280
I was wondering
how the Pro Bono was coming.

902
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,350
I'm all over it.

903
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,650
That makes me very happy,

904
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,280
because if I were to find out

905
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,520
that you weren't putting in
your full effort,

906
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,780
I'd be very upset.

907
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:04,190
No worries. We're all good.

908
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,930
Rachel! Rachel, Rachel,
Rachel. I need your help.

909
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,300
There's a hearing
on my subpoena.

910
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:17,870
I've got three cases
in front of you,

911
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:18,870
so you're gonna have
to wait in line.

912
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,940
No. No, no, no.

913
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,540
My hearing is tomorrow.

914
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,870
So why are you coming to me?

915
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,670
Because Donna says

916
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,080
you're the best researcher
in the firm.

917
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,050
Let me see the motion.

918
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:32,420
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

919
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,220
You have an office?

920
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,950
How do you have an office
and I have a cubicle?

921
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,150
Like you said,
I'm the best researcher

922
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,990
in the firm. Really?

923
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,560
I just made that up.

924
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:45,030
I didn't even have time
to talk to Donna.

925
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:48,100
Is this all a joke to you?

926
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,300
'Cause I take my job seriously.

927
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,770
No, I'm sorry.

928
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:53,200
Look, I was...

929
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:55,670
look, you weren't there, okay.

930
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,040
I care about this woman.

931
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,180
She's got
nowhere else to turn...

932
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,680
and you can't help her
by yourself.

933
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,980
I can.

934
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:06,880
I just prefer not to.

935
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:10,390
Okay.

936
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,790
You're asking to look
at private files

937
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,220
without any evidence
of your assertion.

938
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:14,390
Yeah, but the only way
that we can find

939
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,190
the evidence is to look
at those files.

940
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,190
It's a rickety argument.

941
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,360
But is there a precedent?

942
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:23,170
Let's go see
if we can find one.

943
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:25,740
Research is as much art
as science,

944
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,440
so we're gonna look
at privacy and harassment law

945
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,810
so you can find a combination
of cases

946
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:32,610
to make an argument.
I'll take privacy.

947
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,240
I'll take harassment law.

948
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:35,810
This'll take a while.

949
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,480
We're gonna need dinner.

950
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,620
- Chinese.
- No.

951
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,050
I can afford Chinese on my own.

952
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,850
This is on the firm.
I want sushi.

953
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,560
Ooh.

954
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,760
So they told me to put
my top investigator on it.

955
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:49,060
- What did you do?
- What could I do?

956
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:50,830
You were out of the country,
I gave them Luderman.

957
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,070
By the way, that dress...

958
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:55,400
What, this old thing? Come on.

959
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:57,500
Beautiful.

960
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:59,310
Vanessa, why don't we do this
more often?

961
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:02,310
'Cause it always ends
the same way.

962
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,510
Then why are we doing it now?

963
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,980
Harvey, I don't sleep around.

964
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:09,410
And I could never be
in a relationship with you.

965
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,650
All you ever think about
is yourself.

966
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,290
I'm thinking about you and me
right now.

967
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,960
Please. I insist.

968
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,160
But I'm a gentleman.

969
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:23,330
Besides, you came through

970
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,230
on Dockery for me,
and I'm not one

971
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,130
to forget a favor.

972
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,140
Neither am I.

973
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,950
Mr. Dockery,
you naughty, naughty boy.

974
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,190
You remember when I said
you thought you were too smart

975
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,490
to be a paralegal? Mm-hmm.

976
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,590
- Why...
- Aren't I a lawyer?

977
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,660
Mm.

978
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:54,260
I don't test well. What?

979
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:56,360
I am smart.

980
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:58,000
And I know
I'd be a good lawyer.

981
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,430
I just... I don't know
what it is.

982
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,400
I can't take tests,

983
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:03,440
and I bombed the lsats.

984
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:04,870
And even if I could get

985
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,070
into law school, there's no way

986
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:08,010
I'd pass the bar.

987
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:12,610
So if only there was someone
who could take the test for me.

988
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,980
- Yeah, if only there were.
- Yeah.

989
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:17,850
Hi. Where are you at
with the research

990
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,260
for tomorrow's hearing?
Nothing yet.

991
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,260
You say you care
about the client,

992
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,690
but if you keep playing footsie

993
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,290
instead of finding me
an argument,

994
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,990
the client's gonna lose.

995
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,560
I don't want to lose.

996
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:29,800
Ugh.

997
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:33,270
Look, it's no use.

998
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,670
Okay, their investigation's
by the book.

999
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,010
We look like the bad guys
coming in,

1000
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:38,410
putting them under duress.

1001
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,210
What did you just say?

1002
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,580
I said we look
like the bad guys.

1003
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,480
No, you said

1004
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,050
they did it by the book

1005
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,750
and we're putting them
under duress.

1006
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:51,490
Yeah.

1007
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,160
- Look.
- Hmm.

1008
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,060
This is good.
We're gonna have some fun.

1009
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:59,000
We? I get to go?

1010
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,460
You didn't think
I'd let you come along?

1011
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:02,530
- No.
- Good instinct. I wasn't.

1012
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,070
But then I thought
it'd be cruel

1013
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,800
not to let you witness
my greatness.

1014
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,110
- Okay, can I go get my bag?
- No.

1015
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:09,980
- You're a true giver.
- Other side.

1016
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,080
Okay.

1017
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:15,150
Your honor, this case
should be thrown out.

1018
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:16,980
Other than her story,
the plaintiff doesn't have

1019
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,920
one piece of evidence.

1020
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:21,050
Because the evidence lies
within their personnel files,

1021
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,690
which they're conveniently
refusing to hand over.

1022
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,560
Those files contain
sensitive information.

1023
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,190
He's fishing at the expense

1024
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,800
of our employees' right
to privacy.

1025
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,160
Please.
They don't give a rat's ass

1026
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:33,100
about his employees' right
to privacy.

1027
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:36,140
Sorry, that's actually unfair
to rats' asses.

1028
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,140
Your honor, Mr. Specter's
claim that we don't care

1029
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:40,240
about our employees,
though belittling,

1030
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:42,740
doesn't carry any weight
as a rule of law.

1031
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:45,150
True, but what does carry
weight is that an investigation

1032
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,880
of sexual harassment
must be conducted

1033
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,180
without any duress.

1034
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,480
Your point?

1035
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,480
The investigator
and every person

1036
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:53,550
being interviewed
answers to the ceo

1037
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:54,950
they're investigating.

1038
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:59,760
That is the definition
of duress.

1039
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:01,060
It'd be as if your bailiff

1040
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:03,460
accused you of sexual harassment

1041
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:05,000
and you assigned
your stenographer

1042
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:07,270
to investigate.

1043
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,740
Now how likely would it be

1044
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,840
that this investigation
yielded any fruit?

1045
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:13,940
You honestly think
I would harass Herman?

1046
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:15,380
Well, I don't know, your honor.

1047
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,140
Some people have a thing
for the uniform.

1048
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:20,210
Ugh. I'd like to think
Herman would come to me

1049
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,480
before it even got
to an investigation.

1050
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:27,050
I saw that.
That should be stricken.

1051
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,420
But what if Herman did come
to you, your honor?

1052
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:31,330
And you betrayed his trust

1053
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:33,530
by firing him
under false pretenses?

1054
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,360
You really think
that little of me?

1055
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:38,770
I wouldn't trust you
as far as I could throw you.

1056
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:40,940
Your honor.

1057
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,470
Hand over the files...

1058
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,940
- Oh...
- Today.

1059
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,840
That's it.

1060
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:51,310
Herman, I'd like to speak
to you in chambers.

1061
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:54,080
That was awesome.

1062
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:55,150
It was your argument.

1063
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:56,650
I just framed it in a way

1064
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,120
that humanized the situation

1065
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,660
and brightened
all of our afternoons.

1066
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,290
I feel like Michael corleone
in that scene

1067
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,360
where that fat guy teaches him
how to shoot that gun.

1068
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:04,460
Are you saying
that I'm the fat guy?

1069
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,900
'Cause I'm not the fat guy.

1070
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,500
Mm.

1071
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:10,170
You know what his name was?

1072
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,740
- Yeah.
- Cordoza.

1073
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:13,170
- Clemenza.
- I knew that.

1074
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,540
I was just testing
to see if you knew it.

1075
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:17,140
I knew that you knew
that I knew.

1076
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,920
♪ ♪

1077
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:33,860
Train wreck.

1078
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:35,190
Hey, I'm looking

1079
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:36,530
for rene.

1080
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,360
I'm rene. I'm sorry.

1081
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:42,070
We don't sell skinny jeans
at this location.

1082
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:45,400
Did Harvey tell you
I was coming, or...?

1083
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:47,300
Harvey Specter sent you?

1084
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:49,370
That's another story.

1085
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,910
Do you know your inseam?

1086
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,540
I don't.
It's probably a medium.

1087
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:56,550
Oh. Why don't you browse
for a while?

1088
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:57,680
These are the most exclusive,

1089
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:58,780
and we move down in price

1090
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:02,590
as you head to the door.

1091
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:05,660
Oh. Okay.

1092
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,330
Large?

1093
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,030
That's not how it works.

1094
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,440
Huh.

1095
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:30,650
So Trevor's getting you to do
his dirty work for him, huh?

1096
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,350
All I know is you
aren't talking to each other.

1097
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,350
I miss you.

1098
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,690
I want things

1099
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,120
to go back
to the way they were.

1100
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:39,520
I miss you too. But...

1101
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:41,190
I'm not sure
things are ever going back

1102
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:42,390
to the way they were.

1103
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:45,030
I gotta go.

1104
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,600
What did he say?

1105
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:48,100
He said things
aren't ever going back

1106
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:50,770
to the way they were.

1107
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,570
What did you do?

1108
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,340
I don't know.

1109
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,440
Hey.

1110
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:03,350
So the files are on their way.

1111
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:04,710
We won?

1112
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:05,710
That's fantastic.

1113
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,080
So now we have a week

1114
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:09,350
to corroborate Nancy's story.

1115
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:13,690
Listen, I couldn't have done it
without you.

1116
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,390
You wouldn't even know
where to look without me.

1117
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,530
You know what nobody likes?

1118
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:19,760
Nobody likes a showoff.

1119
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:23,470
Hello.

1120
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:24,630
Yeah, he's here.

1121
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,470
Okay. Thank you.

1122
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,400
Files are in conference room C.

1123
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:32,210
Why wouldn't they bring them
to my cubicle?

1124
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,280
They're trying to bury you
in paperwork.

1125
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:38,150
Well, they picked
the wrong guy.

1126
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,880
If they didn't, I did.

1127
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:41,320
Get it done
by the end of the week.

1128
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,520
I got to run
and charm our new client.

1129
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:50,030
Nice to finally meet you.

1130
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:54,100
Jessica says you're
gonna sweep me off my feet.

1131
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,230
I'll do my best, Mr. Dockery.

1132
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,430
You got a nice serve there.

1133
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,970
Working on it.

1134
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:04,070
What the hell is this?

1135
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:04,970
It's you having sex
with a woman

1136
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,910
who isn't Mrs. Dockery.

1137
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,480
Are you trying to blackmail me?

1138
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,110
You asked my firm
where you're vulnerable

1139
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,280
to corporate takeover.

1140
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:12,950
That's it right there.

1141
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,010
What are you pulling here?

1142
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,520
Your wife owns 10%

1143
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,450
of the company's voting shares.

1144
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,090
You've been seeing this woman
and several others

1145
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,590
for quite some time.

1146
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,220
How do you think
your wife's gonna vote

1147
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:24,690
after she finds out?
Who says she has to find out?

1148
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,300
My investigator got these
within a week.

1149
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,900
What do you think
a motivated competitor's

1150
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:31,730
gonna dig up in a year?

1151
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,400
I have a solution.

1152
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:38,310
Trade her your preferred shares,

1153
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:39,670
which have no voting rights,

1154
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,710
for her common shares,
which do.

1155
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:44,110
The preferred shares
are worth $2 million more.

1156
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,450
A fraction of what you'll lose

1157
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:47,150
if you get voted
out of your company.

1158
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,580
John, I don't care if you sleep

1159
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:50,080
with every woman
in the Hamptons.

1160
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:52,280
Just give her
the preferred shares.

1161
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:57,620
Jessica said you were gonna
charm me to get my business.

1162
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:59,390
I'm not interested
in getting your business.

1163
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:01,960
I'm interested in keeping it.

1164
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:04,100
I know where
they don't want us to look.

1165
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,630
Did you get through
all those files in one night?

1166
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,030
I would have done it faster,

1167
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,800
but I ordered a pizza.

1168
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:11,870
Speaking of which,
have you ever had

1169
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,470
the cheese in the crust?

1170
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:16,410
Because it blew my mind.
What'd you find?

1171
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:19,410
There was a dismissal
on march 12th, 2005.

1172
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,710
But the file with the employee
name on it is missing.

1173
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,310
It's our woman. I know it is.

1174
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,310
I'm moving to slap sanctions

1175
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,080
on their attorney,
possible jail time.

1176
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,850
Guy's not gonna know
what hit him.

1177
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,620
Dennis, it's Harvey Specter.

1178
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:36,490
Did you have anything to do
with the march 12, 2005 files

1179
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,660
left out of discovery?

1180
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:41,000
If they're here by noon,
I'll believe you.

1181
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:44,200
If not,
we're filing for sanctions.

1182
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:46,600
Threat of sanctions is better
than filing for sanctions.

1183
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,440
That's what I meant.
Threaten, not file.

1184
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:50,510
Who would mean that?

1185
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,810
Shave.

1186
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,880
Have you ever heard
of this woman?

1187
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:56,210
Joanna Webster?

1188
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,910
No. Why?

1189
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,380
The company's trying
to hide her from us.

1190
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,120
You think Hunt did
the same thing to her

1191
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:02,720
that he did to me? Yes.

1192
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:05,490
Then you have to make her
come forward and say so.

1193
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,920
Yeah. That's the plan.

1194
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:09,490
Thank you.

1195
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:20,140
Joanna Webster?

1196
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,470
Can I help you?

1197
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,840
Hi. My name's Mike Ross.

1198
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:25,070
I'm a... I'm a lawyer.

1199
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:26,710
I have some questions for you

1200
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:29,850
about your time
at Devlin McGreggor.

1201
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:31,850
Please. Look, just let me
tell you a story

1202
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,950
about my client, okay?

1203
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:36,390
Fine. Just a second.

1204
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:37,890
Mr. Ross,

1205
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:40,390
what happened to me
happened six years ago.

1206
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,020
It was horrible,

1207
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:43,430
and there was a reason
I didn't do anything

1208
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:44,560
about it.

1209
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:46,100
They'll put me on that stand

1210
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,300
and attack me,
and I don't want that.

1211
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:52,300
Ms. Webster, Joanna,

1212
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,870
this man is a predator,

1213
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:58,010
and if you don't help stop him,
he will do it again.

1214
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,680
All you have to do
is give a deposition.

1215
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:04,410
I'm sorry.

1216
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,150
I can't do it.

1217
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:18,960
What happened with the witness?

1218
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:23,270
Uh, I failed...

1219
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:26,470
To not be awesome.

1220
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,900
I got her to testify!

1221
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:32,040
You should have seen me.
I tried everything.

1222
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:33,810
He'd do it again,

1223
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,080
I'd be with her every step
of the way...

1224
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:36,150
Nothing worked.

1225
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,880
And then it hit me.

1226
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:42,150
I asked her
what if it was her daughter

1227
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:43,790
that he did this to.

1228
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,820
She melted.

1229
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,890
And you know how I came up
with that little gem?

1230
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,070
I cared about her. Oh.

1231
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:55,830
Yeah.

1232
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,770
Thank you.

1233
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,270
I'm glad to see
that staying up all night

1234
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,370
doesn't make you act
like a complete idiot.

1235
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,070
Go home and get some sleep.

1236
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:03,410
I don't want you waving
that thing around

1237
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,680
during tomorrow's deposition.

1238
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,050
Harvey.

1239
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,450
How's the pro Bono going?

1240
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:18,190
Great. I just talked a witness
into testifying.

1241
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:21,290
Really?
What's the witness's name?

1242
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,330
I'm not an idiot.

1243
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,860
Don't treat me like one.

1244
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,670
You pawned off the case.

1245
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:30,340
Jessica,
I've got higher profile cases...

1246
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,540
Need I remind you
that when we first met,

1247
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:34,310
you were a screw-up?

1248
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:36,140
I gave you a shot
at the mail room,

1249
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,580
led you up the ranks, and then
paid for you to go to Harvard,

1250
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,620
where, by the way,
you jerked off the entire time

1251
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,690
you were there,
and I still hired you.

1252
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:46,760
And you've benefited
from that ever since.

1253
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,690
Look, I closed the Dockery case,
okay.

1254
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,630
You made a promise to me.

1255
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:54,230
You broke it, and then you lied
to my face.

1256
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,300
So let me be clear.
This isn't professional.

1257
00:54:57,370 --> 00:54:58,930
This is personal.

1258
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,670
And I'll tell you
something else.

1259
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:04,710
You made your bed,
you better goddamn win.

1260
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:21,720
God damn it.

1261
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:34,600
What the hell is wrong with you?
I need the briefcase back.

1262
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:36,140
Oh, so that's what this
has been about, huh?

1263
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:38,210
You don't care
about our friendship at all.

1264
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,840
You're my oldest friend,
and you know it.

1265
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:42,080
But you don't seem
to care about that anymore,

1266
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:43,680
and, yeah, I need
the briefcase back.

1267
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:45,410
And I'm gonna find it, Mike.

1268
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,920
Well, I ditched it
when I was running away

1269
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,890
from the cops
that you sent me into.

1270
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:14,910
Mike.

1271
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,580
Where you going?

1272
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:19,020
To my cubicle.

1273
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:22,050
No, you're not.
It's pee in a cup time.

1274
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,560
I'm sorry. What?

1275
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:26,990
Drug test. Follow me.

1276
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:30,100
I'm just gonna put my stuff
back...

1277
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,030
now.

1278
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:43,180
Oh, by the way, my cousin
was your year at Harvard.

1279
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:45,410
And I asked him if he knew you.

1280
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,850
It's so funny. He didn't.

1281
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,180
Well, what's his name?

1282
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:50,480
Mitch samberg.

1283
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:52,220
Yeah. Don't know him.

1284
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,860
It's a big school.

1285
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,920
Not really.

1286
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:59,690
We get 7,000 applications
a year.

1287
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,000
You think you can just walk in
and take a tour?

1288
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:04,000
Oh, Mitchell.

1289
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:05,500
With the slicked back hair,

1290
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:07,000
graduated seventh in the class.

1291
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:09,100
Sure. Yeah. I remember him.

1292
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:11,410
Time to face the music.

1293
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,750
I got to get
to the Kendrick filing.

1294
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:20,910
Where the hell is Mike?

1295
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:24,680
I don't know.

1296
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,690
Leave the cup on the counter.

1297
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:32,560
You'll have to leave that
out here.

1298
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:35,000
- Why?
- If you take it in there

1299
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,300
with you, I have to check
to make sure you don't have

1300
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:37,500
another urine sample in it.

1301
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,980
- Where you been?
- Hi. Um...

1302
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:25,510
Getting drug tested, actually.

1303
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:28,180
The deposition's
this afternoon.

1304
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:30,050
Before they get here, I want you
to grill this woman

1305
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,520
about her background
for anything they might use

1306
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:32,720
against her.

1307
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:34,490
You got it? Got it.

1308
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,020
- Make her tell you everything.
- Everything.

1309
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:37,120
- Everything.
- Everything.

1310
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:39,990
- Okay.
- Okay.

1311
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,800
I had been working six months

1312
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:53,640
when Mr. Hunt started asking me
to work more,

1313
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:55,510
order dinner.

1314
00:58:55,580 --> 00:59:00,220
One night, late, he tried
to have sex with me.

1315
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:04,190
The next day, I requested
a change in assignment.

1316
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:07,890
Two months later I was fired
for having a bad attitude.

1317
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,490
This is ridiculous.

1318
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,160
Wipe that smirk off your face.

1319
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:13,660
You're not even supposed
to be here.

1320
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:16,330
Mr. Hunt has every right
to be here.

1321
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,600
Now, Ms. Webster, after working
for Devlin McGreggor,

1322
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:23,270
you then went on to waitress
at Hooters, right?

1323
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:26,270
- Yes, I did.
- A place that advertises

1324
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:28,710
the sexuality
of its waitstaff, correct?

1325
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:30,980
You will have to ask them that.

1326
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:32,910
I'm asking you.

1327
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:37,080
And she's not answering.
Move on.

1328
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:42,420
Ms. Webster, would you say
that you're a truthful person?

1329
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:45,030
Yes.

1330
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:47,700
So when you said earlier
that you had never been arrested

1331
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,870
for a crime, you were speaking
the truth?

1332
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:54,240
- Yes.
- Yes, so in 1993 then

1333
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:58,070
you were not arrested for
stealing $1,000 worth of jewelry

1334
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:01,380
from the willow grove mall
in Pennsylvania?

1335
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,780
I was 17. That was one mistake.

1336
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:07,880
Those records were supposed
to be sealed.

1337
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:09,850
So when you say
those records were sealed,

1338
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,320
what you mean to say
is you thought

1339
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:12,350
you could get away with a lie?

1340
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,060
No, that's not it.

1341
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:16,060
You're making it seem
different that it is.

1342
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,830
I'm sorry.
You were arrested in your past

1343
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:20,560
and you lied about it here
under oath.

1344
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:22,660
Is that
making it seem different

1345
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:24,570
than what it is?

1346
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:30,510
No answer. Hmm, all right.

1347
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:33,140
Let me ask you this,
since you've lied here once,

1348
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:35,880
what's to make us believe
you're not lying about Mr. Hunt?

1349
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:50,790
How the hell did you miss
that arrest?

1350
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:52,930
I did every background check
we have.

1351
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,100
Did you grill her
like I told you to?

1352
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,730
It was a sealed record, Harvey!

1353
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:56,730
Goddamn it, I knew it.

1354
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,530
Fix it.

1355
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,470
Joanna! Wait. Please!

1356
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:03,210
This is why I didn't want
to testify.

1357
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:04,740
They twist something
from 100 years ago

1358
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:07,010
and make me look like a liar.

1359
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,180
They make it sound
like what he did

1360
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,780
to me didn't happen.

1361
01:01:09,850 --> 01:01:11,310
It doesn't matter. All right?

1362
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:12,710
I just... I need you
to testify on Friday

1363
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:14,550
and keep this case alive.

1364
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:16,250
We don't have time to find
anyone else before...

1365
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:17,520
would you please wait?

1366
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:19,320
No. I'm not waiting.

1367
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:20,790
You promised this
wouldn't happen, and it did.

1368
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:23,290
You never told me
you were arrested.

1369
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:26,030
Don't contact me again, please.

1370
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:06,560
What happened with the witness?

1371
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:10,500
Nothing. Nothing happened.
I couldn't fix it.

1372
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:13,470
So you're going to quit?

1373
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:15,870
It's either that
or have Louis Litt fire me.

1374
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,410
What are you talking about?

1375
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,650
My first day,
Louis fired Gary Lipsky

1376
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:21,310
for screwing up a case.

1377
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:22,950
He said if I did the same thing

1378
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:25,050
I'd be gone just as fast.

1379
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,420
Well, you go back
to the witness' house

1380
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:28,190
and you get her
to testify again.

1381
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:30,120
- I tried. There's no way.
- There's always a way.

1382
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:31,620
Then why don't you go
and convince her?

1383
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:33,360
Because you screwed it up.

1384
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:35,460
Oh, and you don't give
a damn about the client. Right.

1385
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:37,270
- That's not my job.
- Does your job

1386
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:38,670
include giving a damn about me?

1387
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:40,270
Because the least
you could do is offer

1388
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:41,940
to stand up to Louis for me.
Stand up for you?

1389
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,310
I put my ass
on the line for you,

1390
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:44,810
but it turns out
you may have had the balls

1391
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:46,780
to get this job,
but you don't have the courage

1392
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,480
to stick it out
when it gets tough.

1393
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:49,910
- That's not true.
- Isn't it?

1394
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:51,610
You've had one foot
out the door

1395
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,450
since you got here.
What are you talking about?

1396
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,780
I'm talking
about that briefcase

1397
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:56,490
being locked in your desk.
Yeah, I saw it.

1398
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:58,450
And I know what it is.

1399
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,790
It's your backup plan
in case this doesn't work out.

1400
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,620
You can make some quick cash
and go right back

1401
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:04,930
to the life you told me
you didn't want to lead.

1402
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:07,660
So if you want to quit,
go ahead.

1403
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:10,630
But this isn't because of Louis,
and it isn't because of me.

1404
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:12,230
It's because you're afraid
you might have to admit

1405
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,470
that you're not
as smart as you think you are.

1406
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:19,010
If you're here in the morning,

1407
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,810
I'll know
I still have an associate.

1408
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:15,900
Hey, I get that you were upset

1409
01:04:15,970 --> 01:04:17,530
that I was promoted before you,

1410
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,900
but if you ever threaten to fire
one of my guys again,

1411
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:22,340
I am going to kick your ass.

1412
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:25,780
Hmm.
What are you talking about?

1413
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,640
Don't play dumb with me,
all right?

1414
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:31,750
You fired Gary Lipsky
in front of Mike Ross.

1415
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:34,450
What's so funny?

1416
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,820
Gary Lipsky works
in the mail room.

1417
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:40,990
- What?
- I didn't fire anyone.

1418
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:42,190
That's how I let
the new associates know

1419
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:44,090
what's expected of them.

1420
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:48,000
You plant a fake employee
to manipulate the assoc...

1421
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:49,230
that's it.

1422
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,430
What?

1423
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:18,730
Michael.

1424
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:22,300
I want to quit.

1425
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:25,570
Come here.

1426
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:36,850
When your parents died,

1427
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:41,450
I lost
my son and my daughter-in-law.

1428
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:47,390
I was scared, alone,
and I was too old to raise you.

1429
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:49,300
But I had no choice.

1430
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:55,100
Because who else was going
to care of my grandson?

1431
01:05:55,170 --> 01:05:58,870
You made me a promise before.

1432
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:02,310
You're in the door.

1433
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:05,080
Promise me now the only way
you'll leave

1434
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:08,450
is if they rip you out.

1435
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:22,070
You can save your breath.

1436
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:23,230
There's no way I'm testifying

1437
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:24,970
at the hearing tomorrow.

1438
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,540
That's not why I'm here.

1439
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,870
I know what you did.
What are you talking about?

1440
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:32,040
You never worked
for Devlin McGreggor,

1441
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:34,180
and you were never harassed
by Mr. Hunt.

1442
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,140
- That's a I...
- Now I could tell you

1443
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:38,450
that I've got the canceled
checks or the wire transfer

1444
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:41,320
or whatever smoking gun
that exists... I don't.

1445
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:42,820
But I will. And when I do,

1446
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,380
you'll be going to jail
unless you tell me

1447
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:46,820
what happened right now.

1448
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:50,660
I'm the guy you tell.

1449
01:06:53,730 --> 01:06:56,660
All I had to do was waste
your time until tomorrow

1450
01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:58,530
after the hearing.

1451
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:02,570
Please,
I just needed the money.

1452
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,870
I don't want to go to jail.

1453
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:08,640
Here's what you're gonna do...

1454
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:11,580
Did you call this place before?

1455
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:13,350
Mike!

1456
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:14,450
- Hey.
- I'm not giving this to you

1457
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,220
because you need it.

1458
01:07:16,290 --> 01:07:19,290
I'm giving it to you
because I don't.

1459
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:21,790
And I don't know if I'm ready
to forgive you yet or not,

1460
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:24,460
but I do know we're even.

1461
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:28,260
Wait a second.

1462
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,470
I...

1463
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:35,340
Well...

1464
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,680
Don't.

1465
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:44,710
Now we're even.

1466
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:49,720
Huh.

1467
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:06,600
I see you came to work today.
Nice suit.

1468
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:09,240
It was a barter transaction.

1469
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:12,270
I got six of them
for one little briefcase.

1470
01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:18,980
Listen...

1471
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:20,980
I'm sorry and...

1472
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:23,650
Forget it.

1473
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:27,490
When I first started,
Jessica rode me so hard...

1474
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,490
I quit once a month.

1475
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:32,490
I just told you
what you needed to hear.

1476
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,500
That's just it.
I've only ever had one person

1477
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:39,270
who told me
what I needed to hear.

1478
01:08:39,330 --> 01:08:42,400
Maybe it's time I started
trusting somebody else.

1479
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:53,950
Merry Christmas.

1480
01:08:58,820 --> 01:08:59,880
Is this for real?

1481
01:08:59,950 --> 01:09:02,590
You know what to do.

1482
01:09:03,790 --> 01:09:06,390
Press until it hurts.

1483
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:11,060
Wire transfer from your
account to Joanna Webster's,

1484
01:09:11,130 --> 01:09:13,500
phone records
with Joanna Webster

1485
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:15,870
prior to her testimony,

1486
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:18,470
and an affidavit stating
you paid Ms. Webster

1487
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:20,370
to falsely testify.

1488
01:09:22,410 --> 01:09:25,080
Mr. Hunt, harassment
is a civil violation.

1489
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:26,480
The penalty is money.

1490
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:28,550
But witness tampering,
that's a crime,

1491
01:09:28,610 --> 01:09:30,050
and you will go to prison,

1492
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:31,380
where I guarantee you'll learn

1493
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:33,220
more about unwanted
sexual advances

1494
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:35,090
than you can possibly imagine.

1495
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:38,560
Do you think
this is going to intimidate me?

1496
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:40,690
Even if this evidence
was credible,

1497
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,130
who are you going to get
to prosecute

1498
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,060
a small-time
witness tampering charge, huh?

1499
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:47,600
Harvey, didn't you graduate
law school

1500
01:09:47,670 --> 01:09:49,770
with the current
U.S. attorney in New York?

1501
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,500
In fact, I did.

1502
01:09:51,570 --> 01:09:53,070
And I think
he might even be interested

1503
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:54,440
in pursuing a case like this.

1504
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:55,910
Wait, are you two still close?

1505
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:57,540
Well, I was the best man
at his wedding.

1506
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:59,080
- Wow.
- No, you weren't.

1507
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:00,410
You're bluffing.

1508
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:01,850
No.

1509
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:03,320
I think I've got
some pictures...

1510
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:06,150
Of us at the ceremony.

1511
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:08,120
Let's see.

1512
01:10:08,190 --> 01:10:10,550
Yeah. Here we are.

1513
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:13,590
You must admit,
I look very dashing.

1514
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:14,860
This is me and his mother.

1515
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:16,330
The woman adores me.

1516
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:17,930
Here we are
at his bachelor party.

1517
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,400
There's no strippers.
It was lame.

1518
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:22,900
But he can't put guys like you
away for sexual harassment

1519
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:24,800
and then go to strip clubs,
now, can he?

1520
01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:26,400
All right. What do you want?

1521
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:28,940
An admission of guilt
and a guarantee

1522
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:31,580
that you'll obtain treatment
before working again.

1523
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:36,080
And Nancy gets reinstated
with back pay.

1524
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:38,920
- Fine.
- And a raise.

1525
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:40,990
Okay. All right.

1526
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:42,720
Are we done?

1527
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:44,420
The kid should be able
to grow up without the burden

1528
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,220
of tuition hanging over
his head, don't you think?

1529
01:10:46,290 --> 01:10:47,390
Which is why
you're also gonna pay Nancy

1530
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:48,730
an extra $250,000.

1531
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,200
Charles.

1532
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,600
Gentlemen.

1533
01:11:14,990 --> 01:11:18,560
Thank you for everything.

1534
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:20,160
You're welcome.

1535
01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:21,660
So just one question.

1536
01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:22,830
Why'd you go to Joanna's house?

1537
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,660
Because I figured it out.

1538
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:26,130
I object.

1539
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,870
I think you did it
because you care.

1540
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:30,140
I did it because it's my job.

1541
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,210
Would you admit it?
You care about me.

1542
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:34,570
I saw you smile when I showed up
for work this morning.

1543
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:38,510
I didn't smile.
I was thinking of a funny joke.

1544
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:40,350
Look,
we start on this tomorrow.

1545
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:42,720
Does this mean
we're officially a team now?

1546
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:44,820
I wouldn't move your things
into Wayne manor just yet.

1547
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:48,720
- So now you're Batman?
- Closer to him than Clemenza.

1548
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:51,860
- Oh, yeah, kilmer.
- Clooney.

1549
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:53,590
Keaton.

1550
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:56,630
Did you really quit
when you first started?

1551
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:58,199
Of course not. I'm not a wuss.
